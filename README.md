This project is a simple CRUD application that consists of a form that can be edited, changes that can be saved to a database, and product information that can be fetched from a database to be rendered onto a page. The framework used is AdonisJS, and uses a Controller to navigate routes on the page. The pages were made using templates in Adonis using the Edge templating engine.
